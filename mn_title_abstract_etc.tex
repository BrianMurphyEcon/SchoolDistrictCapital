\newcommand{\ABSTRACTB}{
We examine public school districts capital spending. Using 2609 school districts over 40 years, we estimate a cointegrated relationship that shows how capital spending in the long run depends on school district population, enrollment, and per capita income. Assuming that capital spending is endogenous to these variables, we estimate an error correction model that shows how capital spending adjusts to shocks to population, income, and enrollment. We find that school spending reacts slowly to shocks and in particular, converges very slowly to the long-run stochastic equilibrium. These patterns are illustrated using graphically using impulse response functions. We find that school districts that make frequent use of borrowing have relatively higher school capital. These results challenge the belief that school districts operate on identical education production possibilities frontiers, suggesting that estimates of the return to school capital may be biased by different district objectives or administrative practices.

\newcommand{\ABSTRACTOLD}{
This paper conducts an empirical investigation of capital expenditures by independent school districts in the United States. Capital spending warrants particular attention due to its significantly more flexible financing compared to current expenditures, which are constrained by numerous institutional factors. This flexibility suggests that school districts may align their capital investments more closely with their preferences. Accordingly, we examine whether capital spending is motivated by enrollment levels or influenced by other factors. Our primary objective is to assess whether capital allocation is optimized relative to enrollment. If capital is optimized with respect to enrollment, estimating the rate of return on capital would be appropriate; if not, such estimation may not be feasible. Our empirical findings indicate that both per capita income and population influence capital spending. Furthermore, we find that school districts do not adjust capital investments over time, resulting in substantial disparities in capital per student across different cohorts. Finally, we observe that capital spending is also related to aspects of the administrative structure, such as the frequency of borrowing. The importance of these findings is that school districts appear unlikely to be on their production possibilities frontier in terms of learning, which suggests estimation of the rate of return to capital spending may not yield meaningful results.
