## Overview

This project analyzes long-run patterns in capital investment by public K–12 school districts across the U.S. Using a panel of **2,609 independent school districts in 58 MSAs** from **1979–2018**, we examine:

- Whether capital investment is driven by **student enrollment**, **income per capita**, or **population**
- Whether **borrowing frequency** affects long-run capital levels
- Violations of budget identities that suggest districts may be **using debt to fund current expenditures**
- The **speed of adjustment** to long-run capital levels using an **Error Correction Model (ECM)** framework
- How **administrative behavior** shapes capital stock decisions
